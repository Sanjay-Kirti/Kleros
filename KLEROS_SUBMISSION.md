**Position:** Full Stack Developer  
**Exercise:** D - Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock

## 🎯 Deliverables

### 1. Live Application URL
**URL:** [To be added after deployment]  
**Network:** Sepolia Testnet  
**Recommended Browser:** Chrome with MetaMask extension

### 2. Source Code Repository
**GitHub:** [Your GitHub repo URL]  
**Branch:** main

### 3. Nash Equilibrium Answer

**Question:** What is the Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium of Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock?

**Answer:**  
The mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is for each player to play each of the 5 moves with **equal probability of 1/5 (20%)**.

**Detailed Explanation:**
- Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock is a symmetric zero-sum game
- Each move beats exactly 2 other moves and loses to exactly 2 other moves
- The game has no pure strategy Nash equilibrium (any deterministic strategy can be exploited)
- In the mixed strategy equilibrium, both players randomize uniformly over all 5 moves
- This makes each player indifferent between all strategies
- Expected payoff for both players is 0 (fair game)
- Any deviation from uniform randomness can be exploited by the opponent

**Mathematical Proof:**
- Let p₁, p₂, p₃, p₄, p₅ be the probabilities of playing Rock, Paper, Scissors, Spock, Lizard
- For Nash equilibrium: p₁ = p₂ = p₃ = p₄ = p₅ = 1/5
- This ensures no player can improve their expected payoff by deviating

## ✅ Requirements Checklist

### Must Have (All Implemented):
- ✅ Web3 page allowing parties to play the game
- ✅ Works on MetaMask using Ethereum testnet (Sepolia)
- ✅ Player 1 creates game with commitment
- ✅ Player 1 selects opponent and stakes ETH
- ✅ Player 2 pays same amount and chooses move
- ✅ Player 1 reveals move
- ✅ Contract distributes ETH to winner or splits on tie
- ✅ Timeout mechanisms implemented
- ✅ Uses provided smart contract (unmodified)
- ✅ Secure salt handling (cryptographically random)
- ✅ Prevents ETH loss through proper validation

### Not Required (As Per Instructions):
- ❌ Smart contract development (used provided contract)
- ❌ Tests (not required for this exercise)
- ❌ Fancy interface (clean, functional UI provided)
- ❌ Multi-browser support (tested on Chrome)
- ❌ Multiple simultaneous games (single game assumption)

---

## 🔐 Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Cryptographic Salt Generation
```typescript
export function generateSalt(): string {
  const randomBytes = new Uint8Array(32);
  window.crypto.getRandomValues(randomBytes);  // NOT Math.random()
  return '0x' + Array.from(randomBytes, byte => 
    byte.toString(16).padStart(2, '0')).join('');
}
```
- Uses Web Crypto API for cryptographically secure randomness
- 256-bit entropy (matches Ethereum security level)
- Prevents move prediction attacks

### 2. Commitment Scheme
```typescript
export function hashMove(move: Move, salt: string): string {
  return ethers.solidityPackedKeccak256(['uint8', 'uint256'], [move, salt]);
}
```
- Player 1's move hashed with salt before deployment
- Only hash stored on-chain initially
- Prevents Player 2 from seeing Player 1's move
- Uses packed encoding to match Solidity 0.4.26 contract

### 3. Input Validation
- Frontend validates all inputs before transactions
- Prevents invalid addresses, zero stakes, self-play
- Smart contract provides additional validation layer
- Saves gas by catching errors early

### 4. LocalStorage Persistence
- Salt and move stored locally for Player 1
- Survives page refresh
- Prevents ETH loss if browser closed
- Only accessible to same origin

### 5. Timeout Protection
- Player 1 can claim if Player 2 doesn't play (5 min)
- Player 2 can claim if Player 1 doesn't reveal (5 min)
- Prevents griefing attacks

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Technology Stack:
- **Frontend Framework:** React 19 with TypeScript
- **Web3 Library:** Ethers.js v6.15.0
- **Blockchain:** Ethereum Sepolia Testnet
- **Wallet Integration:** MetaMask
- **Smart Contract:** Solidity 0.4.26 (provided)
- **Build Tool:** Create React App
- **Styling:** Custom CSS

### Key Features:
1. **Automatic Network Switching:** Detects and switches to Sepolia
2. **Real-time Status Updates:** Transaction progress shown to user

## 🎮 How to Test

### Prerequisites:
1. Chrome browser with MetaMask installed
2. Two Ethereum accounts with Sepolia ETH
3. Get Sepolia ETH from: https://sepoliafaucet.com/

### Testing Steps:

**As Player 1:**
1. Visit the live URL
2. Connect MetaMask
3. Select move (e.g., Rock)
4. Enter Player 2's address
5. Set stake (e.g., 0.001 ETH)
6. Click "Create Game"
7. Confirm transaction
8. Wait for Player 2

**As Player 2:**
1. Switch MetaMask to Player 2 account
2. Refresh page
3. Select move (e.g., Paper)
4. Click "Submit Move"
5. Confirm transaction with same stake

**As Player 1 (Reveal):**
1. Switch back to Player 1 account
2. Refresh page
3. Click "Reveal Your Move"
4. Confirm transaction
5. See winner and ETH distribution
